# Igniting our App
// For code to be production ready, we need to optimize, minify the code and bundle it.
// React alone does not make our app fast but there are various packages which helps in making app fast and optimized

# what it takes to build a CRA?
// NPM - It is not Node Package Manager; It manages packages or dependencies. It helps us to get any Package into our app which supports javascript.

// npm init -> Package.json is created (configuration for npm). Keeps track of what version(approx) of packages is needed.

// Bundler - Minifies, bundles our to make it ship to production. (Webpack[CRA+Bable], Parcel, Vite)
// dependencies - Development dependencies (-D), Normal dependencies

# Getting parcel into our app
npm install -D Parcel

// It creates package-lock.json and node_modules
// package-lock.json - keeps track of locked(exact) version of dependencies
// node_modules(collection of dependencies) - contains all the code which we added to our app using npm; Never push this code to github; It contains all the transitive dependent code.
// use 'npm install' to get the node_modules if deleted, you need to have package.json and package-lock.json so you can regenerate the node_modules

//.gitignore - helps to not push files to github
// ^ (carat) : automatic minor version update
// ~ (tilde) : major update

// npx parcel index.html - executes app
// dist -> contains production build file (.html, .css, .js)
// .parcel-cache -> constain cached data for faster build

# Parcel
- dev build
- local server
- HMR (hot module replacement)
  -> File Watching Algorithm (immediate changes reflect after ctrl+s)
  -> Faster Builds using Caching(.parcel-cache)
- image optimization
- minification and bundling of prod build
- compression for easy shipping
- consistent hashing
- code splitting
- differential building (browserlists) : multi-browser support
- diagnostic and error handling
- HTTPS support
- Removal of unused code (tree shaking algorithm)

# dev build - npx parcel index.html
# prod build - npx parcel build index.html
